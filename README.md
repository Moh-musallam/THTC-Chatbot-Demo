# üß† THTC Chatbot Demo ‚Äì Geospatial AI Assistant (2022‚Äì2025)

Welcome to the **THTC Chatbot Demo**, a powerful AI assistant that lets you query and explore Saudi Arabia's road network using natural language. It uses geospatial data from the years **2022 to 2025** and supports advanced insights, summaries, trends, and comparisons.

## üöÄ Features

‚úÖ Ask questions like:

* "Show roads with speed > 100 km/h in Jan 2025"
* "Compare King Fahd Road between Jan 2025 and Jan 2023"
* "What is the average speed in 2023?"
* "Top 5 longest roads in 2022"

‚úÖ Supports:

* Road filtering by name, distance, speed, year
* Year-to-year comparisons (table or summary)
* Trend visualizations over time
* Anomaly detection (high speed/distance)
* Conversational memory for follow-up questions
